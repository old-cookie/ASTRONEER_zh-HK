The texture could not be converted to VT due to its usage in materials (may be connected to a property that doesn't support VT).
The texture is an engine asset, a converted copy will be created in the current project.
The texture was not selected and furthermore is under the threshold size but should still be converted to vt because it's using a shared parameter with other VT textures.

This mesh currently has no valid Skeleton. Would you like to create a new Skeleton?
This only converts animation data -i.e. animation assets and Anim Blueprints. <lf>If you'd like to convert SkeletalMesh, use the context menu (Assign Skeleton) for each mesh. <lf><lf>If you'd like to convert mesh as well, please do so before converting animation data. <lf>Otherwise you will lose any extra track that is in the new mesh.
This texture was included because of the following dependencies:
Touch Interface Setup
Vector Curve
Vector Field
Volume Texture
Warning
Will always open asset in a new window, and not re-use existing window. (Shift+Double-Click)
Would you like to add following bones to the skeleton?
You need to create a Skeleton or assign one in order to open this in Persona.

Click to consolidate foliage into the main foliage actor.
Fix
Foliage in this map is missing a component for static mesh {MeshName}. This has been repaired.
Foliage instances for a missing static mesh have been removed.
Level {Level} has an unexpected duplicate Instanced Foliage Actor.
Instanced meshes don't yet support unique static lighting for each LOD. Lighting on LOD 1+ may be incorrect unless lightmap UVs are the same for all LODs.
The total lightmap size for this InstancedStaticMeshComponent is large, consider reducing the component's lightmap resolution or number of mesh instances in this component
The total lightmap size for this InstancedStaticMeshComponent is too big no matter how much we reduce the per-instance size, the number of mesh instances in this component must be reduced
The total lightmap size for this InstancedStaticMeshComponent was too big and it was automatically reduced. Consider reducing the component's lightmap resolution or number of mesh instances in this component

If checked the cooker will skip editor content and not include it in the build.
If checked, DLC will be built without the content released with the original game.
If checked, DLC will include engine content which was not included in original release, if not checked will error when accessing content from engine directory.
If checked, a new numbered pak will be generated with patch content
If checked, content will be diffed against source content and only changed files will be included in new pak
If checked, content will be generated compressed.  These will be smaller but potentially take longer to load
If checked, ini files stored inside pak file will be encrypted.
If checked, only modified content will be cooked, resulting in much faster cooking times. It is recommended to enable this option whenever possible.
If checked, the content will be deployed as a single UnrealPak file instead of many separate files.
If checked, the content will be deployed as multiple UnrealPak files instead of many separate files.
If checked, the content will be split into multiple paks and stored as data that can be downloaded.
If checked, the version is assumed to be current at load. This is potentially dangerous, but results in smaller patch sizes.
If checked, unchanged pak files present in the base release version will be staged.

<RichText.Header>What does it do?</><lf><lf>The SRichTextBlock uses a concept called Decorators to introduce new font styles, images, animation and even whole interactive widgets inline with the text.<lf><lf>Slate comes with a couple Decorators out of the box:<lf><lf>        •  <RichText.Text.Fancy>Text</> Decorator<lf>        •  <img src="RichText.ImageDecorator"/> Image Decorator<lf>        •  <RichText.WidgetDecorator>Widget</> Decorator<lf>        •  <a id="HyperlinkDecorator" style="RichText.Hyperlink">Hyperlink</> Decorator<lf><lf><RichText.Header>What about options?</><lf><lf>Of course you can always introduce your own Decorators by implementing ITextDecorator. This will give you full customization in how your text or widget is styled. <lf><lf>Besides the power of Decorators the SRichTextBlock comes equipped with Margin support, Left-Center-Right Text Justification, a Line Height Scalar and Highlighting.<lf><lf><RichText.Header>How does the markup work?</><lf><lf>Well the markup parser is customizable so you can adjust the markup anyway you'd like by providing your own parser.  The parser that comes with Slate though uses a syntax very similar to xml.<lf><lf>        •  &lt;TextBlockStyleName>Your text content&lt;/><lf>        •  &lt;img src="SlateBrushStyleName"/><lf>        •  &lt;a id="YourCustomId"/>Your hyperlink text&lt;/><lf><lf>If you ever want to use the markup syntax as actual text you can escape the markup using xml style escapes. For example:<lf><lf>        •  <    &amp;lt;<lf>        •  >    &amp;gt;<lf>        •  "     &amp;quot;<lf><lf>But you only need to escape these characters when a set of them match actual syntax so this isn't generally an issue.<lf><lf><RichText.Header>Are there any catches?</><lf><lf>There are still plenty of things the SRichTextBlock doesn't currently support. The most notable lacking feature is not having the ability to flow text around images or widgets. 
<RichText.TextHighlight>SMultiLineEditableText</> utilizes the power of text marshallers to control how the source text is displayed, and the two editors below are demonstrating the <RichText.TextHighlight>FRichTextLayoutMarshaller</> and <RichText.TextHighlight>FRichTextSyntaxHighlighterTextLayoutMarshaller</> implementations.<lf><lf>You can use the toolbar to control the style of the text in the rich-text editor, or you can directly edit the source text (demonstrating live injection of style information) to update the rich-text view.
